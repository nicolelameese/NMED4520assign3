            <h3 class="card__title">What is a Box Office Flop?</h3>
            <p class="card__discription">A box office flop can be described as a film that makes less money in it's opening weekend
                then amount of money that was put into it. Often times it is preferable for a film to create a profit so a film flops 
                when the film does not 'break even' in the box office. For Walt Disney Animation Studios this meant that any film that 
                cannot make its funds back is considered a flop and major changes in the Walt Disney Company happened due to many of 
                these flops.

            <h3 class="card__title">Why Care About Box Office Flops?</h3>
            <p class="card__discription">Many of these box office flop films had low audience reception, according to Rotton Tomatoes, 
                but many of these films later on became cult classics. Addionally, I believe many of these lower rated films are meant
                to connect more with the youth audience than the adult's giving them their ratings. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="card__title">But, What Are Walt Disney's Animated Flops?</h3>
            <p class="card__discription">Disney is very well known for their animated hit films such as Snow White, Cinderella, Aladdin,
                and more resently Frozen, Moana, and Encanto. There is so much known about the Walt Disney Company and the Walt Disney 
                Animation Studios that we are able to get mostly accurate information to see which movies truly were box office flops 
                and what happened as a result of these flops for the Walt Disney Studios.<br> Although there is more than ten of their 
                animated films that can be considered flops, we will only focus on ten specificlly chosen ones that are the top worst 
                for their full-length animated pictures.

                <p class="card__discription"> In 1940, just three years after the smash hit Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs they released Pinocchio, which is a darker and 
                    more mature film that was released in the midst of the Second World War, just a year before the United States of America entered 
                    the war. With of budget of $52 million, adjusted for inflation, to only make back less than $39 million. Although this film did 
                    not preform well in its initial release, it critically a masterpiece and is highly rated on Rotton Tomatoes by both the audience 
                    and professionals averging out at 84%.

                    <p class="card__discription">Also released in 1940, Walt Disney's Fantasia which was a visual expirence for classical music, consisting of illistrated 
                        short stories that give emotion to the music. It was released only in special theaters for it's initial release due to 
                        theaters requiring a system called 'Fantasound' to play the film. Even though it required special care for it's release 
                        it still made nearly $43 million dollars on a $45 million dollar budget, both numbers adjusted for inflation. The critiques 
                        and audience score averaged out on Rotton Tomatoes is also very high considering it was not a box office hit, with a 89%.

                <p class="card__discription">Next big box office flop for Walt Disney Studios was Alice in Wonderland in 1951, coming off the back of mega sucess Cindarella,
                    Alice in Wonderland was just not as well recieved during it's initial release. With a budget of 35.5 million they only made $28 
                    million meaning their loss was nearly $10 million dollars in 1951, these numbers have been adjusted for inflation. The audience 
                    score on Rotton Tomatoes is considerably high when averaged out by the audience members reviews and the professional reviewers 
                    giving it an 81%.

                    <p class="card__discription">In 1959 Disney released Sleeping Beauty, their next big princess movie after Cindarella in 1950, so they expected a large 
                        turn out, but it only made $36 million dollars in its opening week in the box office. It is believed that was the case 
                        due to the frightening look of the villan Malificient, who has later on become an anti-hero in the world of Disney. The 
                        budget of Sleeping Beauty was nearly double what it made in the initial box office at $60 million, but even though it 
                        was a poorly preforming film doesnt mean the viewers did not love and enjoy it as it's aderage score on Rotton Tomatoes 
                        is 84.5%. All of these numbers where adjusted for inflation.

                    yet mainstreamed so these and many other Walt Disney animated films were re-released every 10 years and that was the only way 
                    for anyone to see a disney film and this is also how Disney continued to make money on the same films. Now back to the box

                <p class="card__discription">In 1985, Disney released the biggest box office flop in their animated full lenght feature film history with The Black Cauldron, 
                    this film was not only a flop at the box office after a strech of good films, but it was also a flop in its story, animation, 
                    and execution as many minutes were removed from the film just weeks before its release. It is one of the lowest ranking films 
                    for Disney with a combined score of 51.5% of the reviews, and only made $53 million on a $110 million budget, numbers have been 
                    adjusted for inflation.

                <p class="card__discription">After the invention on home video with VHS Disney decided to release their films again on home movie, but 
                    they only could get these films for a limited amount of time as they would soon be placed back into the 'Disney Vault' meaning 
                    they were no longer avalible for purchase until the next time there were out of the vault. This is a practice similar to the one 
                    from before, but instead of theatrical re-releases they were home video releases and this is how they would continue to make money 
                    on their old films, calling them classics and re-introducing the films to the next generation. Arguably this worked out very 
                    sucessfully for Disney as their older films are still some of even the younger generations favourite films.

                        Roy E. Disney, wanted to recreate his uncle Walt's most creative film, so in 1999, Fantasia 2000 was released to commemorate not 
                        only the legacy of Walt Disney, but also the onset of the new millennium. Getting an average score of 78% on Rotton Tomatoes from 
                        its audience and reviewers and only being released in IMAX theaters for the first 6 months of its initial release, similar to 
                        the original release of Fantasia. With a budget of $135 million this film only ended up making less than $4 million dollars,

                <p class="card__discription">This 2002 film release from Walt Disney Animation Studios came right after a decade long sucess strech and was the dream film of the 
                    two directors John Musker and Ron Clements who made many beloved 90s films including, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, that came from 
                    what is commonly known as the Disney Renaissance. This was a period of tim that was the resurgance of the Walt Disney Animated films 
                    popularity. Treasure Planet was one of the biggest budget films ot have been made at the time due to its early usage of CGI animation, 
                    costing nearly $221 million dollars to make. Sadly, this love child film only made $60 million dollars in the box office opening and 
                    has an overall rating on Rotton Tomatoes of 70.5% as later on in its life it became a cult classic to those who grew up with the film 
                    and si-fi junkies.

                        of this film, but it made less than $21 million dollars during its opening box office release. This farm animal focused film was 
                        also very poorly recieved by the audiences gettign an average ranking score of 40.5% on Rotton Tomatoes making it the worst rated

                <p class="card__discription">Disney animated films slowly started becoming less and less popular due to the increasing popularity of computer animation so Disney joined 
                    the train and created this science-fiction film, but it missed all the marks of a hit film. Disney spent $211 million dollars to create this 
                    film, but only made roughly $35 million and got a mid level rating from Rotton Tomatoes of 70.5%.

                        to include LBGTQ+ characters and was perhaps ahead of its time. Strange World has a budget of $180 million, but made less then $26 million in 
                        the box office opening week. Perhaps people became framiliar with Disney's next pattern of a theatrical release followed by an online streaming 
                        release 30 days later on their Disney+ online streaming platform for free with a subscription, so people simply decided to just wait a month to 
                        see the film and the average review on Rotton Tomatoes is only 69%.
