            <h3 class="card__title">What is a Box Office Flop?</h3>
            <p class="card__discription">A box office flop can be described as a film that makes less money in it's opening weekend
                then amount of money that was put into it. Often times it is preferable for a film to create a profit so a film flops 
                when the film does not 'break even' in the box office. For Walt Disney Animation Studios this meant that any film that 
                cannot make its funds back is considered a flop and major changes in the Walt Disney Company happened due to many of 
                these flops. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="card__title">But, What Are Disney's Animated Flops?</h3>
            <p class="card__discription">Disney is very well known for their animated hit films such as Snow White, Cinderella, Aladdin,
                and more resently Frozen, Moana, and Encanto. There is so much known about the Walt Disney Company and the Walt Disney 
                Animation Studios that we are able to get mostly accurate information to see which movies truly were box office flops 
                and what happened as a result of these flops for the Walt Disney Studios. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="card__title">Why Care About The Box Office Flops?</h3>
            <p class="card__discription">Many of these box office flop films had low audience reception, according to Rotton Tomatoes, 
                but many of these films later on became cult classics. Addionally, I believe many of these lower rated films are meant
                to connect more with the youth audience than the adult's giving them their ratings.
